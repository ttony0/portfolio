# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II

## The audience

Originally, I intended to target my audience as ordinary people who love animals or are interested in adopting pets, mainly college students. However, after careful consideration, I finally decided to add resolution from animal shelters' perspective in the call to action part, and defined my target audience as both ordinary people who love and want to protect animals, as well as animal shelters. This is because I believe it is not an issue that can be solved by the efforts of only ordinary people. While it may not be a big problem, it is a problem that related to animals' lives. I believe this issue comes from two factors: first, the public's lack of attention to the survival conditions of "other animals," and second, animal shelters' failure to provide relevant information. After investigating animal shelter adoption website, I found there was no a portal for "other animals." Although Austin has a separate Rabbit Rescue program, it's not visible to potential adopters when visiting animal shelters' website. Therefore, animal shelters need to provide more information about them - at least to show they're making an effort to save these animals.

## Final design decisions

For user feedback, I modified my story based on user feedback in part II, adding some highlighted conclusions near the data viz to make the conclusions more intuitive. I also revised some of the calls to action according to their suggestions.

From assignment feedback, I added transition text between each section to make the entire story goes more smoothly. At the beginning, the storyboard was just for a presentation, but now it feels more like a complete story. I also added some of my own thoughts about the data viz and the whole story, and removed data viz that I didn't create by myself. Additionally, based on feedback, I dug deeper into this problem and modify the calls to action part I wrote. After investigating, I found that Austin does have a rabbit protection program, but it doesn't appear in the animal shelter system, as mentioned in the previous section. You have to search for this program. Moreover, it is true that some animals aren't suitable as pets, like bats and raccoons, so I modified my calls to action accordingly. However, some animals are suitable as pets, such as rabbits and Guinea pigs, which I wrote about in the final section. 

# Final thoughts

After finishing this project, I found it really interesting -- since many students have talked about animal adoption, I had to dig deeper into this topic to tell a compelling story. Just by investigating data and policies through the Internet, I discovered how scarce information about these animals is online. Working on this project allowed me to look into these animals' situations. Though the data sources might be limited, it was still happy to tell a story from these animals' perspective.

This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
Hello, I'm Tongren Chen, deeply passionate about exploring and understanding emerging technologies and concepts. My academic journey, especially in AI research, demonstrates this passion. I started with researching only AI. Then I delved into the exploration of AI applications in data security, not only expanding my technical knowledge but also fueling my enthusiasm for continuous learning. This quest for knowledge isn't just about personal growth; it's about sharing these discoveries and making complex ideas accessible and exciting to others. My ability to absorb and communicate new concepts makes me a valuable asset in any thinking-stimulating environment.

# What I hope to learn
Data, as the best tool for describing objective facts in daily life, has the drawback of not being very intuitive. Data visualization effectively solves this issue. In this course, I am interested in how to visualization different kinds of data, and how I can improve a visualization after it is created. I also hope to learn how to use data visualization to guide the audienceâ€™s attention and combine it with the points I want to convey.

After graduation, I plan to be machine learning engineer or software development engineer. In my career, effectively using data visualization can greatly enhance my ability to summarize and report on my work.

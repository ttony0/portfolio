# Final Project Part I

## Outline

#### Project Summary

The inspiration for this project came from analyzing Austin Animal Shelter data, where I discovered that many animals are still being euthanized. Among cats and dogs, while the euthanasia rates are relatively low at 4.98% and 3.3% respectively, the absolute numbers are significant due to the large population - 1,252 cats and 1,603 dogs. Moreover, for other animal species including bats, raccoons, and rabbits, the euthanasia rate is alarmingly high at 73%. These animals, while potentially suitable as pets, face high euthanasia rates due to lack of attention and adoption opportunities.

#### Project Structure

**Set up:**

Each year about 6.3 million of animals enter animal shelter in the U.S. and approximately 920,000 shelter animals are euthanized *(Pet Statistics, 2022)*. People primarily focus on the data for cats and dogs, however other animal actually facing a high euthanized rate.

**Conflict:**

Just for data in Austin, an animal-friendly city, euthanasia rate is higher than all the other animals including cats, dogs, and birds. These animals includes bat, raccoon, rabbit, and opossum. These are animals that are welcomed on the Internet. Meanwhile, euthanized cats and dogs have a number of 2855, which indicate that there still a lot of animals in the shelter for people to adopt since a lot of families still buying animal from breeders.

**Solution:**

To deal with the high euthanasia rates among non-traditional shelter animals, public education campaigns can be implemented to raise awareness about these potential pets. By demonstrating the unique characteristics and difficult survival situation of animals like rabbits, bats, and raccoons, we can help the public put more focus on these animals.

This viz is used to show the overly high euthanasia rate among other animals and to proof that people are not care about these animals.

From this viz we can see what types of animals that make up the "other animals" category.

## Data

The primary dataset for this project comes from [data.world](https://data.world/), specifically the Austin Animal Center Outcomes dataset. This comprehensive dataset contains detailed records of animal outcomes from the Austin Animal Center, including information about species, intake and outcome types, and dates. I will use this dataset to highlight the analysis of the disparity in euthanasia rates between traditional pets (cats and dogs) and other animals. Using Tableau, I will create visualizations that demonstrate the significantly higher euthanasia rates (73%) among non-traditional shelter animals compared to cats (4.98%) and dogs (3.3%). The first visualization will compare euthanasia rates across different animal categories, while the second will break down the composition of the "other animals" category to show which species are most affected. This data analysis will support the my argument about the need for increased attention and resources for non-traditional shelter animals.

In the future, I plan to search for commercial animal buying data from Austin and the pet owning data from Austin to further proof my argument.

## Method and medium

I will use Shorthand for story telling. On the Shorthand I will demonstrate the types of animals that make up the "other animals" category in a more intuitive way and present my core argument of pay attention to non-traditional animals' adoption.
